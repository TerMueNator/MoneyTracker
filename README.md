# Money Tracker

## A CPSC 210 Term Project

Welcome to **Money Tracker**. This application allows users to track their income and expenses. 
This app has, but not limited to, the following functionalities:
1. add new entries to the record
2. remove and edit each entry in the record
3. display total expense or income of all entries in record

This app serves to showcase my continuing progress in Java programming, 
as well as my submission to UBC's CPSC 210 term project. 

**User Stories**
- As a user, I want to be able to add new entries to the expense record
- As a user, I want to be able to delete entries in the expense record
- As a user, I want to be able to edit entries in the expense record
- As a user, I want to be able to view the total expense/income in the expense record
- As a user, I want to be able to set categories for each expense entry in the record
- As a user, I want to be able to save my expense record into a file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my expense record from a file

**Phase 4: Task 2**

The setAmount method in the ExpenseEntry class throws a ZeroInputException when it is called with 0 as a parameter.

**Phase 4: Task 3**

The project as a whole is a relatively simple program. Given more time, I would most likely refactor my 
ExpenseRecordAppGUI into several smaller, more specialized classes, rather than having 1 which handles all 
user interface codes.
